I wanted to write a simple sudoku solver. Just try out this:

  ruby sudoku.rb *.txt
  
OR
  
  make test (for the c version)
  
I also implemented the solver in c. I just wanted to have some performance
comparison. On my machine i get those numbers (inc. vm/interpreter bootup):

                        real	        user           sys	
  C                 0m0.063s      0m0.057s      0m0.003s
  ruby 1.9.2p0      0m0.241s      0m0.224s      0m0.012s
  ruby 1.8.7p174    0m0.441s      0m0.223s      0m0.012s
